Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating real estate prices in a specific city using historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide accurate and reliable price predictions to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.

Dataset:
The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, a reputable platform for data science competitions and datasets. The dataset includes various features related to real estate properties, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant attributes.

Tools and Libraries:
To analyze and model the data, the following tools and libraries were utilized:

Numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization, enabling us to plot and visually interpret data distributions and trends.
Scikit-Learn (sklearn): For implementing machine learning algorithms, specifically linear regression, to build the predictive model.
Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify any missing or anomalous values.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering:

Selected relevant features that contribute significantly to the target variable (real estate prices).
Created new features based on domain knowledge to enhance model performance.
Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Implemented a linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
Trained the model on the training dataset and validated it using the testing dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed the model’s performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).
Visualized the model's predictions against actual values to interpret its accuracy and identify any patterns or discrepancies.
Results:
The linear regression model demonstrated a satisfactory level of accuracy in predicting real estate prices. The evaluation metrics indicated that the model could reliably estimate prices based on the provided features. Visualization of the predictions further validated the model's effectiveness in capturing the underlying trends in the data.

Conclusion:
This project successfully developed a linear regression model to predict real estate prices using historical data from Kaggle. The model can be utilized by real estate professionals, investors, and analysts to make data-driven decisions. Future work could involve exploring more advanced machine learning algorithms and incorporating additional features to further enhance prediction accuracy.
